# diacrtics-of-a-txt.py
As we know English uses Latin alphabet consisting of 26 characters, both upper- and lower-case:

Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz

However, many other languages use its modified version, with some of the letters removed and additional diacritics added to some of them. For instance, Czech alphabet has following additional characters:

Áá Čč Ďď Éé Ěě Íí Ňň Óó Řř Šš Ťť Úú Ůů Ýý Žž

The worst of all is probably Vietnamese:

Áá Àà Ãã Ảả Ạạ Ââ Ấấ Ầầ Ẫẫ Ẩẩ Ậậ Ăă Ắắ Ằằ Ẵẵ Ẳẳ Ặặ Đđ Éé Èè Ẽẽ Ẻẻ Ẹẹ Êê Ếế Ềề Ễễ Ểể Ệệ
Íí Ìì Ĩĩ Ỉỉ Ịị Óó Òò Õõ Ỏỏ Ọọ Ôô Ốố Ồồ Ỗỗ Ổổ Ộộ Ơơ Ớớ Ờờ Ỡỡ Ởở Ợợ
Úú Ùù Ũũ Ủủ Ụụ Ưư Ứứ Ừừ Ữữ Ửử Ựự Ýý Ỳỳ Ỹỹ Ỷỷ Ỵỵ

My job is to write a method twistUp which "twists up" a string, making it as much filled with diacritics as possible.
